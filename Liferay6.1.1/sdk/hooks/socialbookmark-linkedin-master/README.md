socialbookmark-linkedin
=======================

This hook adds the 'share on linkedin' button to the social bookmark links in Liferay.

The sourcecode was copied from https://github.com/liferay/liferay-plugins/tree/master/hooks/social-bookmarks-hook.
Once the hook is deployed you only need to add 

social.bookmark.types=twitter,facebook,plusone,linkedin

to add support for the linkedin share functionality
